# builder_gui_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
	• The Builder pattern adheres to SRP by separating the construction and representation of complex objects from their actual implementation. Each Concrete Builder is responsible for creating a specific complex object, and the Director is responsible for coordinating the building process.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
	• The Builder pattern supports OCP by allowing new types of complex objects to be added without modifying the existing client code. You can introduce new Concrete Builder classes to create different variations of complex objects.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
	• The Liskov Substitution Principle is not directly applicable to the Builder pattern as it deals with inheritance and subtype relationships. However, there are no inheritance relationships involved in this pattern.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
	• The Builder pattern aligns with ISP because it uses separate interfaces for specifying the construction steps in the abstract builder. Clients interact with the builder through these specific interfaces and are not forced to depend on methods they don't need.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
	• The Builder pattern supports DIP by decoupling the client code (Director) from the specific implementations (Concrete Builders). The Director interacts with the abstract builder interface, which allows it to work with any Concrete Builder that implements that interface.
Overall, the Builder pattern demonstrates adherence to SOLID principles by promoting separation of concerns, modularity, and flexibility in constructing complex objects. It enables the creation of different object configurations while keeping the client code decoupled from the specific construction process.
