1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
	• The Abstract Factory pattern adheres to SRP because it focuses on a single responsibility: creating families of related objects. Each concrete factory class is responsible for creating objects of a specific family.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
	• The Abstract Factory pattern supports OCP by allowing the addition of new object families (concrete product classes) without modifying existing client code. Clients depend on the abstract factory interface, which remains unchanged while new factories can be introduced to provide different variations of the objects.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
	• The Liskov Substitution Principle is not directly applicable to the Abstract Factory pattern as it primarily deals with inheritance and subtype relationships. However, it is important to ensure that all concrete factories implement the abstract factory interface correctly, providing the expected family of objects.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
	• The Abstract Factory pattern aligns with ISP as it defines a separate interface (abstract factory) for creating related objects. Clients only depend on this specific interface and are not forced to rely on methods they don't need.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
	• The Abstract Factory pattern supports DIP by depending on abstractions (the abstract factory interface) rather than concrete implementations. Clients interact with the abstract factory interface, decoupling them from the specific concrete factory classes.

Overall, the Abstract Factory pattern demonstrates adherence to SOLID principles by promoting separation of concerns, extensibility, and dependency inversion. It helps achieve modular, maintainable, and loosely coupled code by focusing on abstractions and encapsulating object creation logic within dedicated factories.
